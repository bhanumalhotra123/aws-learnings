1.User Data is generally used to perform common automated configuration tasks and even run scripts after the instance starts. When you launch an instance in Amazon EC2, you can pass two types of user data - shell scripts and cloud-init directives. You can also pass this data into the launch wizard as plain text or as a file.

Scripts entered as user data are executed as the root user, hence do not need the sudo command in the script. Any files you create will be owned by root; if you need non-root users to have file access, you should modify the permissions accordingly in the script.

By default, user data scripts and cloud-init directives run only during the boot cycle when you first launch an instance. You can update your configuration to ensure that your user data scripts and cloud-init directives run every time you restart your instance.


2.You manage access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources. A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or role) makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. AWS supports six types of policies: identity-based policies, resource-based policies, permissions boundaries, Organizations SCPs, ACLs, and session policies.

Identity-Based Policies: Policies attached to IAM users, groups, or roles to define what actions they can perform.

Resource-Based Policies: Policies attached to AWS resources, such as S3 buckets or Lambda functions, to control access from other AWS accounts or entities.

Permissions Boundaries: IAM policy that sets the maximum permissions a user or role can have, allowing more fine-grained control.

Organizations SCPs (Service Control Policies): Policies applied at the organizational level to control permissions for member accounts within AWS Organizations.

ACLs (Access Control Lists): Legacy method for managing permissions on S3 buckets and objects, providing granular control over who can access the resources.

Session Policies: Policies associated with temporary security credentials assumed via AWS STS (Security Token Service) to further restrict permissions for a session or role.

3.A launch template is similar to a launch configuration, in that it specifies instance configuration information such as the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, security groups, and the other parameters that you use to launch EC2 instances. Also, defining a launch template instead of a launch configuration allows you to have multiple versions of a template.

With launch templates, you can provision capacity across multiple instance types using both On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances to achieve the desired scale, performance, and cost.

A launch configuration is an instance configuration template that an Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instances. When you create a launch configuration, you specify information for the instances such as the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, one or more security groups, and a block device mapping.

You cannot use a launch configuration to provision capacity across multiple instance types using both On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances. 

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
  MyAutoScalingGroup:
    Type: AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup
    Properties:
      LaunchTemplate:
        LaunchTemplateName: MyLaunchTemplate
      MinSize: 5 # Base capacity
      MaxSize: 20 # Maximum desired capacity
      DesiredCapacity: 10
      MixedInstancesPolicy:
        InstancesDistribution:
          OnDemandPercentageAboveBaseCapacity: 30
          SpotAllocationStrategy: lowest-price # or other strategy

With this configuration, when your Auto Scaling group is set to a desired capacity of 10 instances, here's what happens:

The base capacity is 5 On-Demand Instances (MinSize).
The additional instances above the base capacity are calculated as 30% of 5, which is 1.5 (rounded up to 2).
So, you have 5 base On-Demand Instances and 2 more On-Demand Instances above the base capacity, totaling 7 On-Demand Instances.
The remaining 3 instances (10 total - 7 On-Demand) are Spot Instances.

4.Application Load Balancer can be used to securely authenticate users for accessing your applications. This enables you to offload the work of authenticating users to your load balancer so that your applications can focus on their business logic. You can use Cognito User Pools to authenticate users through well-known social IdPs, such as Amazon, Facebook, or Google, through the user pools supported by Amazon Cognito or through corporate identities, using SAML, LDAP, or Microsoft AD, through the user pools supported by Amazon Cognito. You configure user authentication by creating an authenticate action for one or more listener rules.

There is no such thing as using Cognito Authentication via Cognito Identity Pools for managing user authentication for the application. Application-specific user authentication can be provided via Cognito User Pools. Amazon Cognito identity pools provide temporary AWS credentials for users who are guests (unauthenticated) and for users who have been authenticated and received a token.

You cannot directly integrate Cognito User Pools with CloudFront distribution as you have to create a separate Lambda@Edge function to accomplish the authentication via Cognito User Pools. This involves additional development effort, so this option is not the best fit for the given use-case.

5.FSx for Lustre is a file system better suited for distributed computing for HPC (high-performance computing) and is very expensive

6.AWS Certificate Manager is a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for use with AWS services and your internal connected resources. SSL/TLS certificates are used to secure network communications and establish the identity of websites over the Internet as well as resources on private networks.

AWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account. This includes how the resources are related to one another and how they were configured in the past so that you can see how the configurations and relationships change over time.

AWS Config provides AWS-managed rules, which are predefined, customizable rules that AWS Config uses to evaluate whether your AWS resources comply with common best practices. You can leverage an AWS Config managed rule to check if any ACM certificates in your account are marked for expiration within the specified number of days. Certificates provided by ACM are automatically renewed. ACM does not automatically renew the certificates that you import. The rule is NON_COMPLIANT if your certificates are about to expire.

You can configure AWS Config to stream configuration changes and notifications to an Amazon SNS topic. For example, when a resource is updated, you can get a notification sent to your email, so that you can view the changes. You can also be no



Certificate Request: When you request an SSL/TLS certificate, you specify the domain(s) you want to secure, such as "example.com" or "www.example.com."

Validation Methods: To prove that you have control over the domain, the CA uses various validation methods. One of the common methods is DNS validation.

DNS Validation: For DNS validation, the CA provides you with a unique value (a cryptographic token) that you need to add to your domain's DNS configuration as a DNS record. This record is usually a CNAME (Canonical Name) or TXT (Text) record with a specific name and value.

CA Checks: The CA then checks the DNS records to confirm that the provided value matches what is in the DNS configuration for the domain. If the validation is successful, it means that you have control over the domain, and the certificate is issued.

Certificate Installation: Once the certificate is issued, you install it on your web server or load balancer to enable secure HTTPS connections.

Certificate Renewal: SSL/TLS certificates have a limited validity period, typically ranging from a few months to a few years. To maintain secure connections, certificates need to be renewed before they expire.

Renewal Validation: During certificate renewal, the CA may repeat the validation process, which includes checking the DNS records to ensure that the domain owner still has control over it.

The DNS records used for certificate validation are critical during both the initial certificate issuance and subsequent renewals. If these DNS records are missing, modified, or incorrect, the CA cannot validate the domain's ownership, and the certificate renewal may fail. This could result in the loss of HTTPS connectivity and pose security risks.

Therefore, it's crucial to maintain and regularly monitor your DNS records, especially those used for SSL/TLS certificate validation, to ensure that certificates are renewed successfully and web services remain secure. Certificate management services like ACM help automate and streamline this process.

The relationship between SSL/TLS certificates and DNS records is closely tied to the process of certificate issuance and validation. When you secure a domain or a subdomain with an SSL/TLS certificate, the Certificate Authority (CA), which could be a third-party CA or a service like AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), needs to confirm that you have control over the domain for which you're requesting the certificate. This verification is crucial to prevent fraudulent certificates from being issued.

Here's how the relationship works:

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) does not attempt to renew third-party certificates that are imported. Also, an administrator needs to reconfigure missing DNS records for certificates that use DNS validation if the record was removed for any reason after the certificate was issued. Metrics and events provide you visibility into such certificates that require intervention to continue the renewal process. Amazon CloudWatch metrics and Amazon EventBridge events are enabled for all certificates that are managed by ACM. Users can monitor days to expiry as a metric for ACM certificates through Amazon CloudWatch. An Amazon EventBridge expiry event is published for any certificate that is at least 45 days away from expiry by default. Users can build alarms to monitor certificates based on days to expiry and also trigger custom actions such as calling a Lambda function or paging an administrator.

It is certainly possible to use the days to expiry CloudWatch metric to build a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the imported ACM certificates. The alarm will, in turn, trigger a notification to the security team. But this option needs more configuration effort than directly using the AWS Config managed rule that is available off-the-shelf.

Any SSL/TLS certificates created via ACM do not need any monitoring/intervention for expiration. ACM automatically renews such certificates.





7.Use Amazon S3 Bucket Policies

Bucket policies in Amazon S3 can be used to add or deny permissions across some or all of the objects within a single bucket. Policies can be attached to users, groups, or Amazon S3 buckets, enabling centralized management of permissions. With bucket policies, you can grant users within your AWS Account or other AWS Accounts access to your Amazon S3 resources.

You can further restrict access to specific resources based on certain conditions. For example, you can restrict access based on request time (Date Condition), whether the request was sent using SSL (Boolean Conditions), a requester’s IP address (IP Address Condition), or based on the requester's client application (String Conditions). To identify these conditions, you use policy keys.

Use Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies - AWS IAM enables organizations with many employees to create and manage multiple users under a single AWS account. IAM policies are attached to the users, enabling centralized control of permissions for users under your AWS Account to access buckets or objects. With IAM policies, you can only grant users within your own AWS account permission to access your Amazon S3 resources. So, this is not the right choice for the current requirement.

Use Access Control Lists (ACLs) - Within Amazon S3, you can use ACLs to give read or write access on buckets or objects to groups of users. With ACLs, you can only grant other AWS accounts (not specific users) access to your Amazon S3 resources. So, this is not the right choice for the current requirement.
