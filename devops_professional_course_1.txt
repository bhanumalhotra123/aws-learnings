CICD Intro

We will learn about:

AWS Code Commit
AWS Code Pipeline
AWS Code Build
AWS Code Deploy
AWS Code Star
AWS Code Artifact
AWS Code Guru


Continous Integration:
Developers push the code to a code repository often ( eg- Github, CodeCommit, Bitbucket)

A testing/ build server checks the code as soon as it is published ( CodeBuild, Jenkins CI etc)

The developer gets feedback about the tests and checks that have passed/failed.

  Find bugs early, then fix bugs

Deliver faster as the code is tested

Deploy often

Happier developers, as they're unblocked.


Continous Delivery:

Ensures that the software can be released reliably whenever needded.
Ensures deployments happen often and are quick.
Shift away from "one release every 3 months" to "5 releases a day"
That usually means automated deployment(CodeDeploy[EC2 Instances, On-premises Instances, AWS Lambda, Amazon ECS], JenkinsCD etc)

Orchestrate using AWS Code Pipeline


AWS CodeCommit

Version Control is the ability to understand the various changes that happenedd to the code over time (and possibly roll back)
All these are enabled by using a version control system such as Git
A git repository can be synchronized on your computer, but it usually is uploaded on a central online repository.

Benefits are:
Collabrate with other developers
Make sure the code is backed-up somewhere
Make sure it is fully viewable and auditable.


Why codecommit?

Git repositories can be expensive

Using AWS CodeCommit:
  Private Git repositories (Code lives and stays within your VPC)
  No size limit on repositories
  Code Only in AWS Cloud account [Increased Security and compliance.
