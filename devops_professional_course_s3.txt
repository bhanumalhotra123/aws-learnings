AWS Lambda Versions

When you work on a Lambda function we work on $LATEST
When we are happy with our code state we can publish it can create a new version.
now the version you create say V1 is immutable.
then next version V2 will also be immutable

Versions get their own ARN(Amazon Resource Name)
Version = code + configuration(nothing can be changed)
Each version of the lambda can be accessed


Lambda Aliases

Pointers to Lambda function versions
We can defina a dev, test, prod aliases and have them point at different lambda versions
Aliases are mutable

Aliases enable canary deployment by assigning weights to lambda functions.
Aliases enable stable configuration of our event triggers/ destinations.

Aliases have their own ARNs
Aliases can't refer to other aliases.



Go to Lambda > Create function >  Author from scratch > Function Name > Runtime > Create Function


import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return "this is version1"

>Deploy it 

Then >Test
Create new test event
Event template
Event name
>Create

Then >Test

Say we are very happy with this code and we want name it version1
>Action >Publish new version from $LATEST

>Publish

This has created version1  [Now we can't change the code in it]
Test the function

Now say we want to keep on editing our version

Go back to our main function

import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return "this is version2"

>Deploy 
>Test

>Actions > Publish new version from $LATEST
>Publish


Now we need to play with aliases

Under Versions Tab we can see all the versions we created

Now go to alias tab 
>Create Alias 
Name: dev
Version: $LATEST

>Create Alias
Name: Test
Version: 2

>Create Alias
Name: Prod
Version: 1


With aliases we can start doing some weights

Aliases Tab
Select prod >Edit
>weighted alias >Additional version: 2 Weight: 50
>Save

Now >Test

in results it will show version1 and version2 50% of times each


Once you see version2 is working great 
make weight of version2 100%
