1.VPC sharing (part of Resource Access Manager) allows multiple AWS accounts to create their application resources such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, Redshift clusters, and Lambda functions, into shared and centrally-managed Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). 
To set this up, the account that owns the VPC (owner) shares one or more subnets with other accounts (participants) that belong to the same organization from AWS Organizations. 
After a subnet is shared, the participants can view, create, modify, and delete their application resources in the subnets shared with them.
Participants cannot view, modify, or delete resources that belong to other participants or the VPC owner.
  
You can share Amazon VPCs to leverage the implicit routing within a VPC for applications that require a high degree of interconnectivity and are within the same trust boundaries.
This reduces the number of VPCs that you create and manage while using separate accounts for billing and access control.
Using VPC sharing, an account that owns the VPC (owner) shares one or more subnets with other accounts (participants) that belong to the same organization from AWS Organizations. 
The owner account cannot share the VPC itself.  
  
2.VPN CloudHub  
If you have multiple AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections, you can provide secure communication between sites using the AWS VPN CloudHub. 
This enables your remote sites to communicate with each other, and not just with the VPC. Sites that use AWS Direct Connect connections to the virtual private gateway can also be part of the AWS VPN CloudHub. 
The VPN CloudHub operates on a simple hub-and-spoke model that you can use with or without a VPC.
This design is suitable if you have multiple branch offices and existing internet connections and would like to implement a convenient, potentially low-cost hub-and-spoke model for primary or backup connectivity between these remote offices.  
  
3.Software VPN - Amazon VPC offers you the flexibility to fully manage both sides of your Amazon VPC connectivity by creating a VPN connection between your remote network and a software VPN appliance running in your Amazon VPC network. 

4.You should use AWS Glue or Amazon EMR to facilitate ETL workloads.  

5.Storage Gateway  
The service provides three different types of gateways – Tape Gateway, File Gateway, and Volume Gateway – that seamlessly connect on-premises applications to cloud storage, caching data locally for low-latency access. With cached volumes,   
the AWS Volume Gateway stores the full volume in its Amazon S3 service bucket, and just the recently accessed data is retained in the gateway’s local cache for low-latency access.  
  
With stored volumes, your entire data volume is available locally in the gateway, for fast read access.  
Volume Gateway also maintains an asynchronous copy of your stored volume in the service’s Amazon S3 bucket.  

6. An NLB can be configured to take an Elastic IP. However, with hundreds of ALBs, the NLB-ALB combination will be equally cumbersome to manage.  

Business reporting or data warehousing scenarios; you may want business reporting queries to run against a read replica, rather than your primary, production DB Instance.  

7.AWS Directory Service provides multiple ways to use Amazon Cloud Directory and Microsoft Active Directory (AD) with other AWS services.
AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (aka AWS Managed Microsoft AD) is powered by an actual Microsoft Windows Server Active Directory (AD), managed by AWS. With AWS Managed Microsoft AD, you can run directory-aware workloads in the AWS Cloud such as SQL Server-based applications. You can also configure a trust relationship between AWS Managed Microsoft AD in the AWS Cloud and your existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory, providing users and groups with access to resources in either domain, using single sign-on (SSO).

AD Connector - Use AD Connector if you only need to allow your on-premises users to log in to AWS applications and services with their Active Directory credentials. AD Connector simply connects your existing on-premises Active Directory to AWS. You cannot use it to run directory-aware workloads on AWS, hence this option is not correct.

Simple AD - Simple AD provides a subset of the features offered by AWS Managed Microsoft AD. Simple AD is a standalone managed directory that is powered by a Samba 4 Active Directory Compatible Server. Simple AD does not support features such as trust relationships with other domains. Therefore, this option is not correct.

Amazon Cloud Directory - Amazon Cloud Directory is a cloud-native directory that can store hundreds of millions of application-specific objects with multiple relationships and schemas. Use Amazon Cloud Directory if you need a highly scalable directory store for your application’s hierarchical data. You cannot use it to establish trust relationships with other domains on the on-premises infrastructure.  

8.Amazon FSx for Windows File Server - Amazon FSx for Windows File Server is a fully managed, highly reliable file storage that is accessible over the industry-standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. It is built on Windows Server, delivering a wide range of administrative features such as user quotas, end-user file restore, and Microsoft Active Directory (AD) integration.

File Gateway Configuration of AWS Storage Gateway - Depending on the use case, Storage Gateway provides 3 types of storage interfaces for on-premises applications: File, Volume, and Tape. The File Gateway enables you to store and retrieve objects in Amazon S3 using file protocols such as Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB).

9.An Internet Gateway serves two purposes: to provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet-routable traffic and to perform network address translation (NAT) for instances that have been assigned public IPv4 addresses. 

10.Amazon DynamoDB enables you to back up your table data continuously by using point-in-time recovery (PITR). When you enable PITR, DynamoDB backs up your table data automatically with per-second granularity so that you can restore to any given second in the preceding 35 days.  
PITR helps protect you against accidental writes and deletes. For example, if a test script writes accidentally to a production DynamoDB table or someone mistakenly issues a "DeleteItem" call, PITR has you covered.  

11.Elastic Fabric Adapter  
An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a network device that you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instance to accelerate High Performance Computing (HPC) and machine learning applications. It enhances the performance of inter-instance communication that is critical for scaling HPC and machine learning applications. EFA devices provide all Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) devices functionalities plus a new OS bypass hardware interface that allows user-space applications to communicate directly with the hardware-provided reliable transport functionality.  

12.Elastic Network Adapter - Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) devices support enhanced networking via single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high-performance networking capabilities. Although enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower inter-instance latencies, still EFA is a better fit for the given use-case because the EFA device provides all the functionality of an ENA device, plus hardware support for applications to communicate directly with the EFA device without involving the instance kernel (OS-bypass communication) using an extended programming interface.  

13.Security Groups are indeed stateful, meaning if you allow inbound traffic from a specific IP or range of IPs, the return traffic (outbound) is automatically allowed, making it easier to manage.  
Network ACLs are stateless, so you need to explicitly define both inbound and outbound rules if you want to control both incoming and outgoing traffic. This is necessary to allow return traffic from ephemeral ports and to control outbound traffic from your subnet.
  
14.Idle Timeout - For each request that a client makes through an Elastic Load Balancer, the load balancer maintains two connections. The front-end connection is between the client and the load balancer. The back-end connection is between the load balancer and a registered EC2 instance. The load balancer has a configured "idle timeout" period that applies to its connections. If no data has been sent or received by the time that the "idle timeout" period elapses, the load balancer closes the connection. "Idle timeout" can not be used to complete in-flight requests made to instances that are de-registering or unhealthy.  
  
15.Connection Draining  
To ensure that an Elastic Load Balancer stops sending requests to instances that are de-registering or unhealthy while keeping the existing connections open, use connection draining. This enables the load balancer to complete in-flight requests made to instances that are de-registering or unhealthy. The maximum timeout value can be set between 1 and 3,600 seconds (the default is 300 seconds). When the maximum time limit is reached, the load balancer forcibly closes connections to the de-registering instance.    
  
16.Use EC2 dedicated hosts  
You can use Dedicated Hosts to launch Amazon EC2 instances on physical servers that are dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts give you additional visibility and control over how instances are placed on a physical server, and you can reliably use the same physical server over time. As a result, Dedicated Hosts enable you to use your existing server-bound software licenses like Windows Server and address corporate compliance and regulatory requirements.  
Use EC2 dedicated instances - Dedicated instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a VPC on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer. Your dedicated instances are physically isolated at the host hardware level from instances that belong to other AWS accounts. Dedicated instances may share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not dedicated instances. Dedicated instances cannot be used for existing server-bound software licenses.  
  
17. An egress-only internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows outbound communication over IPv6 from instances in your VPC to the internet, and prevents the internet from initiating an IPv6 connection with your instances.  
  
18.AWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics. AWS Glue job is meant to be used for batch ETL data processing and it's not the right fit for running a database rollover script. Although AWS Glue is also serverless, Lambda is a more cost-effective option compared to AWS Glue.  
  
19.Alias records let you route traffic to selected AWS resources, such as CloudFront distributions and Amazon S3 buckets. They also let you route traffic from one record in a hosted zone to another record. 3rd party websites do not qualify for these as we have no control over those. 'Alias record' cannot be used to map one domain name to another.  
  
20.Create an A record - Used to point a domain or subdomain to an IP address. 'A record' cannot be used to map one domain name to another.
  
21.Create a PTR record - A Pointer (PTR) record resolves an IP address to a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) as an opposite to what A record does. PTR records are also called Reverse DNS records. 'PTR record' cannot be used to map one domain name to another  

22.CNAME records can be used to map one domain name to another. Although you should keep in mind that the DNS protocol does not allow you to create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace, also known as the zone apex. For example, if you register the DNS name example.com, the zone apex is example.com. You cannot create a CNAME record for example.com, but you can create CNAME records for www.example.com, newproduct.example.com, and so on.  
  
23.Amazon SQS provides short polling and long polling to receive messages from a queue. By default, queues use short polling. With short polling, Amazon SQS sends the response right away, even if the query found no messages. With long polling, Amazon SQS sends a response after it collects at least one available message, up to the maximum number of messages specified in the request. Amazon SQS sends an empty response only if the polling wait time expires.  
Long polling makes it inexpensive to retrieve messages from your Amazon SQS queue as soon as the messages are available. Using long polling can reduce the cost of using SQS because you can reduce the number of empty receives.  
Message Timer: SQS message timers allow you to set a delay before a message becomes available for consumption, ensuring that it is not processed until a specified time has passed.
  
24.You can migrate data to Amazon Redshift databases using AWS Database Migration Service. Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud. With an Amazon Redshift database as a target, you can migrate data from all of the other supported source databases.  
The Amazon Redshift cluster must be in the same AWS account and the same AWS Region as the replication instance. During a database migration to Amazon Redshift, AWS DMS first moves data to an Amazon S3 bucket. When the files reside in an Amazon S3 bucket, AWS DMS then transfers them to the proper tables in the Amazon Redshift data warehouse.   
AWS DMS creates the S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the Amazon Redshift database. The AWS DMS replication instance must be located in that same region.   

25.You cannot use EventBridge events to directly trigger the recovery of the EC2 instance.  
If your instance fails a system status check, you can use CloudWatch alarm actions to automatically recover it. The recover option is available for over 90% of deployed customer EC2 instances. The CloudWatch recovery option works only for system check failures, not for instance status check failures. Also, if you terminate your instance, then it can't be recovered.
You can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that monitors an Amazon EC2 instance and automatically recovers the instance if it becomes impaired due to an underlying hardware failure or a problem that requires AWS involvement to repair. Terminated instances cannot be recovered. A recovered instance is identical to the original instance, including the instance ID, private IP addresses, Elastic IP addresses, and all instance metadata. If the impaired instance is in a placement group, the recovered instance runs in the placement group.
The automatic recovery process attempts to recover your instance for up to three separate failures per day. Your instance may subsequently be retired if automatic recovery fails and a hardware degradation is determined to be the root cause for the original system status check failure.   

The recover action is supported only on instances that have EBS volumes configured on them, instance store volumes are not supported for automatic recovery by CloudWatch alarms.  

26.Although DocumentDB is fully managed, it does not have an in-memory caching layer.  

27.Correct options:

NAT instance can be used as a bastion server
Security Groups can be associated with a NAT instance
NAT instance supports port forwarding
  Incorrect Options:
NAT gateway supports port forwarding
Security Groups can be associated with a NAT gateway
NAT gateway can be used as a bastion server  

28.migrating from RDS to Aurora MySQL generally doesn't require significant changes to your application code, whereas setting up Amazon ElastiCache in front of RDS can potentially require more code modifications, depending on how you integrate the caching layer.   
 Amazon Aurora Replicas share the same data volume as the primary instance in the same AWS Region, there is virtually no replication lag. The replica lag times are in the 10s of milliseconds (compared to the replication lag of seconds in the case of MySQL read replicas). Therefore, this is the right option to ensure that the read replicas lag no more than 1 second behind the primary instance.  

29.AWS CloudFormation StackSet extends the functionality of stacks by enabling you to create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions with a single operation. A stack set lets you create stacks in AWS accounts across regions by using a single AWS CloudFormation template. Using an administrator account of an "AWS Organization", you define and manage an AWS CloudFormation template, and use the template as the basis for provisioning stacks into selected target accounts of an "AWS Organization" across specified regions.  

30.Amazon VPC provides the facility to create an IPsec VPN connection (also known as site-to-site VPN) between remote customer networks and their Amazon VPC over the internet. The following are the key concepts for a site-to-site VPN:  
Virtual private gateway: A Virtual Private Gateway (also known as a VPN Gateway) is the endpoint on the AWS VPC side of your VPN connection.  
VPN connection: A secure connection between your on-premises equipment and your VPCs.  
VPN tunnel: An encrypted link where data can pass from the customer network to or from AWS.  
Customer Gateway: An AWS resource that provides information to AWS about your Customer Gateway device.  
Customer Gateway device: A physical device or software application on the customer side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.  

31.By default, EC2 instances run on a shared-tenancy basis.
Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer. Dedicated Instances that belong to different AWS accounts are physically isolated at the hardware level. However, Dedicated Instances may share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that is not Dedicated Instances.   
A Dedicated Host is also a physical server that's dedicated to your use. With a Dedicated Host, you have visibility and control over how instances are placed on the server.  
ou can only change the tenancy of an instance from dedicated to host, or from host to dedicated after you've launched it  

32.You can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm to automatically recover the Amazon EC2 instance if it becomes impaired due to an underlying hardware failure or a problem that requires AWS involvement to repair. Terminated instances cannot be recovered. A recovered instance is identical to the original instance, including the instance ID, private IP addresses, Elastic IP addresses, and all instance metadata. If the impaired instance is in a placement group, the recovered instance runs in the placement group. If your instance has a public IPv4 address, it retains the public IPv4 address after recovery. During instance recovery, the instance is migrated during an instance reboot, and any data that is in-memory is lost.  

33. Amazon SNS follows the "publish-subscribe" (pub-sub) messaging paradigm, with notifications being delivered to clients using a "push" mechanism. This is an important difference between SNS and SQS. Whereas SQS is a polling mechanism, that gives applications the chance to poll at their own comfort, the push mechanism assumes the other applications are present.   

34.we use scale out; scale in in case of horizontal and scale up and scale down in case of vertical  

35. If either Launch Configuration Tenancy or VPC Tenancy is set to dedicated, then the instance tenancy is also dedicated.  

A launch configuration is an instance configuration template that an Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instances. When you create a launch configuration, you specify information for the instances. Include the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, one or more security groups, and a block device mapping. If you've launched an EC2 instance before, you specified the same information to launch the instance.  

36.Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP.  
 CloudFront supports HTTP/RTMP protocol based requests  
Please note the differences between the capabilities of Global Accelerator and CloudFront -  
AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront are separate services that use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world. CloudFront improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos) and dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery). Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.  
Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover. Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.  
  
37.Amazon GuardDuty offers threat detection that enables you to continuously monitor and protect your AWS accounts, workloads, and data stored in Amazon S3. GuardDuty analyzes continuous streams of meta-data generated from your account and network activity found in AWS CloudTrail Events, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS Logs. It also uses integrated threat intelligence such as known malicious IP addresses, anomaly detection, and machine learning to identify threats more accurately.  

Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data on Amazon S3. Macie automatically detects a large and growing list of sensitive data types, including personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, and credit card numbers. It also gives you constant visibility of the data security and data privacy of your data stored in Amazon S3.  

38. The AWS Transfer Family provides fully managed support for file transfers directly into and out of Amazon S3 and Amazon EFS. Therefore, it cannot support migration into the other AWS storage services mentioned in the given use-case (Amazon FSx for Windows File Server).  

AWS Storage Gateway File Gateway itself is not designed for direct migration into other AWS storage services like Amazon EFS or Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. It's primarily focused on providing access to S3.
Volume gateway can.  

39.Spot Instances with a defined duration (also known as Spot blocks) are designed not to be interrupted and will run continuously for the duration you select. You can use a duration of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 hours. In rare situations, Spot blocks may be interrupted due to Amazon EC2 capacity needs. Therefore, the option - "Spot blocks are designed not to be interrupted" - is correct.   
If a spot request is persistent, then it is opened again after your Spot Instance is interrupted  
Spot blocks are designed not to be interrupted  
When you cancel an active spot request, it does not terminate the associated instance   

40.NLB  
 If you specify targets using an instance ID, traffic is routed to instances using the primary private IP address specified in the primary network interface for the instance. So public IP address cannot be used to route the traffic to the instance.  

41.Delete the existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue(can't convert the existing)    
Make sure that the name of the FIFO queue ends with the .fifo suffix  
Make sure that the throughput for the target FIFO queue does not exceed 3,000 messages per second  

42.
