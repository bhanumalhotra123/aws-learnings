1.VPC sharing (part of Resource Access Manager) allows multiple AWS accounts to create their application resources such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, Redshift clusters, and Lambda functions, into shared and centrally-managed Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). 
To set this up, the account that owns the VPC (owner) shares one or more subnets with other accounts (participants) that belong to the same organization from AWS Organizations. 
After a subnet is shared, the participants can view, create, modify, and delete their application resources in the subnets shared with them.
Participants cannot view, modify, or delete resources that belong to other participants or the VPC owner.
  
You can share Amazon VPCs to leverage the implicit routing within a VPC for applications that require a high degree of interconnectivity and are within the same trust boundaries.
This reduces the number of VPCs that you create and manage while using separate accounts for billing and access control.
Using VPC sharing, an account that owns the VPC (owner) shares one or more subnets with other accounts (participants) that belong to the same organization from AWS Organizations. 
The owner account cannot share the VPC itself.  
  
2.VPN CloudHub  
If you have multiple AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections, you can provide secure communication between sites using the AWS VPN CloudHub. 
This enables your remote sites to communicate with each other, and not just with the VPC. Sites that use AWS Direct Connect connections to the virtual private gateway can also be part of the AWS VPN CloudHub. 
The VPN CloudHub operates on a simple hub-and-spoke model that you can use with or without a VPC.
This design is suitable if you have multiple branch offices and existing internet connections and would like to implement a convenient, potentially low-cost hub-and-spoke model for primary or backup connectivity between these remote offices.  
  
3.Software VPN - Amazon VPC offers you the flexibility to fully manage both sides of your Amazon VPC connectivity by creating a VPN connection between your remote network and a software VPN appliance running in your Amazon VPC network. 

4.You should use AWS Glue or Amazon EMR to facilitate ETL workloads.  

5.Storage Gateway  
The service provides three different types of gateways – Tape Gateway, File Gateway, and Volume Gateway – that seamlessly connect on-premises applications to cloud storage, caching data locally for low-latency access. With cached volumes,   
the AWS Volume Gateway stores the full volume in its Amazon S3 service bucket, and just the recently accessed data is retained in the gateway’s local cache for low-latency access.  
  
With stored volumes, your entire data volume is available locally in the gateway, for fast read access.  
Volume Gateway also maintains an asynchronous copy of your stored volume in the service’s Amazon S3 bucket.  

6. An NLB can be configured to take an Elastic IP. However, with hundreds of ALBs, the NLB-ALB combination will be equally cumbersome to manage.  

Business reporting or data warehousing scenarios; you may want business reporting queries to run against a read replica, rather than your primary, production DB Instance.  

7.AWS Directory Service provides multiple ways to use Amazon Cloud Directory and Microsoft Active Directory (AD) with other AWS services.
AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (aka AWS Managed Microsoft AD) is powered by an actual Microsoft Windows Server Active Directory (AD), managed by AWS. With AWS Managed Microsoft AD, you can run directory-aware workloads in the AWS Cloud such as SQL Server-based applications. You can also configure a trust relationship between AWS Managed Microsoft AD in the AWS Cloud and your existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory, providing users and groups with access to resources in either domain, using single sign-on (SSO).

AD Connector - Use AD Connector if you only need to allow your on-premises users to log in to AWS applications and services with their Active Directory credentials. AD Connector simply connects your existing on-premises Active Directory to AWS. You cannot use it to run directory-aware workloads on AWS, hence this option is not correct.

Simple AD - Simple AD provides a subset of the features offered by AWS Managed Microsoft AD. Simple AD is a standalone managed directory that is powered by a Samba 4 Active Directory Compatible Server. Simple AD does not support features such as trust relationships with other domains. Therefore, this option is not correct.

Amazon Cloud Directory - Amazon Cloud Directory is a cloud-native directory that can store hundreds of millions of application-specific objects with multiple relationships and schemas. Use Amazon Cloud Directory if you need a highly scalable directory store for your application’s hierarchical data. You cannot use it to establish trust relationships with other domains on the on-premises infrastructure.
