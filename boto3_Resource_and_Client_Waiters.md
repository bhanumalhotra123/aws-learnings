Ever needed your code to run exactly when your AWS resource is ready? Introducing AWS Resource and Client Waiters – your secret to solving this challenge effortlessly. Let's break it down with a simple example.

The Challenge:
Imagine using Python and Boto3 to handle AWS EC2 instances. When you start or stop an instance, it goes through stages like "pending" to "running." But what if you want your script to act only when the instance is fully up? ⏳

🚦 Resource Waiters: Patience Pays Off
Resource waiters act as smart watchers. They keep checking an AWS resource's status (like an EC2 instance) and pause your script until it's in the desired state. Start an instance and wait for it to be "running" before your script proceeds. It's like having a green light for your code!

🤼‍♂️Resource vs. Client Waiters:
Both waiters do the job, but slightly differently. Resource waiters check more frequently, like every few seconds for around 3 minutes. If the resource isn't ready by then, your script knows something's up.

Client waiters, however, wait longer between checks – around every 15 seconds – but for a total of 10 minutes. They're perfect when tasks, like software installs during instance start, need extra time.

🤝 Smart Combo: Resource + Client
Here's a cool trick: use both! Kick off the instance with a resource waiter for the "running" signal. Then let the client waiter take over to ensure all those startup extras are done. It's a power duo for precise yet patient automation.
