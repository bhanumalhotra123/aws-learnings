Let's Make It Practical: Monitoring CPU Utilization on EC2

Launch an EC2 Instance: Start by launching an EC2 instance through the EC2 dashboard.

SSH In: Securely access your instance via SSH using the key pair.

Initial CPU Check: Run commands to gauge initial CPU utilization using tools like top or htop.

Browse CPU Metrics: In CloudWatch, find "Metrics" and pick the EC2 service. Explore "Per-Instance Metrics" and locate "CPUUtilization."

Detailed Monitoring: Go to your instance's "Monitoring" tab and enable "Detailed Monitoring" for 1-minute intervals.

Increase CPU Load: Execute an app/script to significantly utilize CPU resources. Get ready to see metrics in action!

Watch the Spike: Back in CloudWatch Metrics, witness the spike in "CPUUtilization" as your app kicks in.

Create an Alarm: In CloudWatch, select "Alarms," then "Create Alarm." Choose the metric (CPUUtilization) and resource (your EC2 instance).

Configure SNS Topics: While creating the alarm, set up an SNS topic for notifications. Specify your email as the endpoint.

Define Alarm Details: Give your alarm a name and a notification message that delivers a punch.

Confirm Subscription: Check your email, confirm the subscription, and get ready for notifications.

Test the Alarm: Run your app/script again and enjoy the triumphant ding of your email notification!
